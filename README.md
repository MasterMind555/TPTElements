## The Powder Toy Coder v. 1.1

The Powder Toy Coder is a simple HTML page which allows you to create TPT elements with relative ease.
Created using Javascript, HTML and CSS. Requires the contentEditable property to work (See [here](http://caniuse.com/#feat=contenteditable) to check out if you can use contentEditable on your browser). Now consists of quite a few files! :O

The minified version is compiled with Closure Compiler.

A live version can be found here: http://boxmein.web44.net/tptelements
