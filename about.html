<h1>About Powder Toy Element Coder</h1>
It started off as something I created with enthusiasm back in summer 2012. I had overthought the entire thing and used loads of unnecessary techniques (such as PHP, AJAX and Server-side Includes) when creating it. The rewrite uses only three files and technologies and it looks minimalistic. I like minimalistic.
The colour scheme has been worked through with <a href="http://colorschemedesigner.com/">colorschemedesigner.com</a>. 
The text scheme is here: <a href="http://colorschemedesigner.com/#3u21TbFuVw0w0">#3u21TbFuVw0w0</a>
and the background is a single color anyways.
 

The code provided is from The Powder Toy by various developers, hosted on 
GitHub. <a href="https://github.com/FacialTurd/The-Powder-Toy/">The-Powder-Toy</a>
(The default code is extracted from src/simulation/elements/BCOL.cpp)
